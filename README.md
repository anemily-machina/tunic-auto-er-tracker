#How to Use

To use this, download the source code zip and open the file called "index.html" with your browser.

The automation ability only works in Chromium based browsers, with the spoiler enabled, and if things are in the default windows places. If you want to try getting the auto tracker to work under other conditions feel free to ask for help.

Probably compatible with Ranomizer Mod 3.0.2 (probably compatible with 3.1.0)

This webpage behaves the same as the original entrace tracker except it has two new buttons in settings.
